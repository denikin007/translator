'Cause I'm Denikin
Put your loving hand out, baby

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm Denikin, Denikin you

And it would end
But easy come and easy go
I walked away, but you warned me then
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Ridin' high when I was king

But I planted that seed, just let me grow
Any time I see you, let me know
Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No
So, any time I need ya, let me go

Hey yeah, ratatata
'Cause I don't want to lose you
I'm on my knees while I'm Denikin

And put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
And put your loving hand out, baby
I'm Denikin, Denikin you

Only then can I begin to live again
The kind of man you want in the end
Tried so hard to be your man
I need you to understand

Was hangin' over me
The shadow of my life
I used to be
An empty shell

To win my soul
Won't even stand the devil's dance
But I don't know
A broken man

Why the feel for the need to replace me?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
What we doin'? What we chasin'?

Ya had it till you took it back
You done gave it away
Like the heart in a trash where you should
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could react
You on a runway track from the good

Girl, I'm Denikin
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Keep browsin' halls
Now the court is yours
Keep walking forward
Keep rockin' dawns
But I keep walkin' on

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
Yeah

I'm just a con about to fade to black
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Just can't make it all alone
I'm fightin' hard to hold my own

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm Denikin, Denikin you

So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm Denikin, Denikin you
